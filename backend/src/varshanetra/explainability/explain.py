"""
Explainability (Section 15).

Tabular features (meteorology, NWP, thermo-wind, static terrain) -> SHAP.
Spatial/thermal imagery (satellite/radar branches)                -> Grad-CAM
                                                                       / attention maps.

Both entry points degrade gracefully (return an approximate, clearly-labeled
fallback) if the optional `shap` / `torch` dependencies aren't installed, so
the rest of the system (warning engine, API) can still run in minimal
environments — but the production path uses the real libraries.

Section 15 also asks the dashboard to be able to answer "why did VarshaNetra
issue this warning?" — `top_contributing_features` implements exactly that,
and is deliberately kept separate from `warning/engine.py::explain_warning`,
which only *formats* whatever this module attributes; it never invents
evidence on its own.
