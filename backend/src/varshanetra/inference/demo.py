"""
inference/demo.py — single-location "current conditions" demo mode.

WHY THIS EXISTS
-----------------
`InferencePipeline.predict()` (Section 13) expects real, already-sourced
sensor/satellite/radar/NWP feature values per grid cell. A frontend that
doesn't have that ingestion built yet (e.g. a UI still on placeholder/mock
data) has no way to call it directly — it would need to invent ~40 raw
feature values itself, which is worse than the mock data it started with,
not better.

This module is the honest middle ground: it generates a short, physically
-consistent synthetic time history (data/synthetic_data.py — the SAME
generator the ablation study and run_mvp.py were validated against) for one
named region, engineers it through the real Thermo-Wind pipeline, and runs
it through the REAL trained model. The prediction is real; only the input
"sensor readings" are simulated, and every response says so explicitly via
`demo_mode: true` and `data_source: "synthetic"` — never silently.

Replace `_current_conditions_for_region` with a real ingestion call (a
weather-API fetch, a database read, an MQTT sensor feed — whatever the
production data source ends up being) once one exists; nothing else in this
module or its caller (inference/api.py::/demo/predict) needs to change,
since the contract is just "return a short causal history DataFrame in the
data/schema.py column format".
